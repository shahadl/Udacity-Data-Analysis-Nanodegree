# project 2: Investigate a TMDb Movie Dataset

## Overview
In this project, I analyzed the TMDb movie dataset by using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. The dataset, which is originally from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data), was cleaned and provided by Udacity. The dataset contains 5000+ movies basic information and some metrics that measured can be classified how successful these movies are. These metrics include popularity, revenue and vote average. Basic information are like cast, director, keywords, runtime, genres, etc. 

The project primary goal is to go through the general data analysis process:
- questions asking 
- data wrangling 
- exploratory data analysis 
- conclusion

so I can answer my questions:
1. Which `genres` are most popular?
2. Is there a positive correlation between the `budget` of the movie and the `reveneu`?
3. Which `year` has most released movies?
4. What is the movie that has the highest `budget`?

## My findings
### 1. Which `genres` are most popular?
