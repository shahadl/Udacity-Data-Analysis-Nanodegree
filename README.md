# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project Portfolio
It contains all the projects i've done in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

# Overview
The nanodegree takes the students through the entire data analysis process that includes Posing a question, Wrangling data into a format one can use and fix any problems with it, Exploring the data, Finding pattrens in it, and building one intuition about it, Drawing conclusions and\or making predictions, and Communicating the findings.

I've also learned how to use the Python libraries `Numpy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib` to write code that's cleaner, more concise, and runs faster.
